Hey Everyone!,

Here are some old assets I made a while back. I decided to collect them and just put them out there. A few things though, looking through some of the folders I couldn't find some of the normals for certain props. So if the asset doesn't have a normal map then it doesn't have it. That's about it, all I can say is enjoy.

P.S 
Don't be afraid to shoot me up comments or critiques regarding the assets. I always love feedback.

Thanks!
